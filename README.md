This library offers true random numbers. The random numbers are generated in [Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T)](http://www.cqc2t.org) lab by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

> The vacuum is described very differently in the quantum mechanical context than in the classical context. Traditionally, a vacuum is considered as a space that is empty of matter or photons. Quantum mechanically, however, that same space resembles a sea of virtual particles appearing and disappearing all the time. This result is due to the fact that the vacuum still possesses a zero-point energy. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the vacuum exhibits random fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all frequencies. By carefully measuring these fluctuations, we are able to generate ultra-high bandwidth random numbers.<sup>[1](#desc)</sup>
