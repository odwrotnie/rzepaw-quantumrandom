# Quantum Random

Quantum Random Numbers Generator

This library offers true random numbers. The random numbers are generated in **Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T)** lab by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. 

> The vacuum is described very differently in the quantum mechanical context than in the classical context. Traditionally, a vacuum is considered as a space that is empty of matter or photons. Quantum mechanically, however, that same space resembles a sea of virtual particles appearing and disappearing all the time. This result is due to the fact that the vacuum still possesses a zero-point energy. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the vacuum exhibits random fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all frequencies. By carefully measuring these fluctuations, we are able to generate ultra-high bandwidth random numbers.
